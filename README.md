## Cardway

Welcome to Cardway, a spaced-reptition that cares about your life and a stepping-stone to an AI tutor for everyone.


## Installation

Cardway is a tauri app that uses Svelte as its frontend and SvelteKit as its router. Install SvelteKit for tauri with the following.

```
npm install --save-dev @sveltejs/adapter-static@next
```

If there is no `build` directory in the root, run `mkdir build` for tauri. That is sufficient for the setup. Now to run the app for development, run

```
npm run tauri dev
```
